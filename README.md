# ArtificialIntelligence

This repository contains solution of some famous problems using Artificial Intelligence.



## 1. What is Artificial Intelligence

The term *Artificial Intelligence* may be a little bit vague, here we mean it any algorithm that solves some problem using one (or more) of the following: 

- Knowledge-based methods
- Data-based methods



## 2. Problems

1. $8$ puzzle , $15$ puzzle, and the more general problem of $nÂ²-1$ puzzle
2. Grindy's Game
3. Iris Classification 



## 3. Solution Approach 

- For each problem, we implemented a solution with emphasis on algorithmic rigor, mathematical rigor, speed and correctness. 

- Each solution will be described in a Jupyter Notebook.
